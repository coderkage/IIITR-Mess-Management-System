# IIITR-Mess-Management-System
## Overview

Welcome to the IIITR Mess Management System repository! This system is designed to streamline the management of mess-related activities at IIIT Raichur. It includes modules for billing, handling complaints, managing the menu, conducting polls, gathering meal ratings, user authentication, and recording voting preferences.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

- PHP: Server-side scripting language for dynamic web development.
- HTML: Markup language for creating web pages.
- CSS: Style sheet language for enhancing the appearance of web pages.
- MySQL: Relational database management system for storing and retrieving data.

## Features

### 1. Billing System

The billing system keeps track of students' mess-related financial transactions. It records the joining and leaving dates, total days stayed in the hostel, and total amount to be paid for detailed billing information.

### 2. Complaint Management

Students can raise complaints through the system, including attaching images for reference. The system keeps a log of complaints, their status (open/closed), resolution dates, and any additional remarks.

### 3. Menu Management

The menu module allows administrators to manage the weekly menu, categorizing meals by day and meal type (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner). Average ratings for each meal are also recorded.

### 4. Polls and Voting

The system facilitates the creation of polls with associated questions. Users, mainly students, can select their meal preference. Preferences are stored for each poll.

### 5. Meal Ratings

Users can provide ratings for specific meals, contributing to an average rating for each meal. This feature helps in evaluating the popularity of different dishes.

### 6. User Management

The user management system includes role-based authentication, distinguishing between roles such as admin, student, secretary, warden, and caterer.
